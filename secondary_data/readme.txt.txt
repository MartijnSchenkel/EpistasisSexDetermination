  Contains a datafile "2020_08_03_data_collected.txt" generated by  
  ../data_analysis_visualisation/2021_03_30_data_analysis_visualization.R. Used to generate Figures 2
  and 3 and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 using the same file. Lists the allele frequencies for 
  every simulation. Variables are as follows:

  Seed		= Seed used for generating parameter values.
  Generation	= Generation at which frequencies are reported (equals total run time)
  SexRatio	= Sex ratio (% males) 
  Frequency	= Allele frequency
  Sex		= Sex in which allele frequency is reported
  LinkageGroup	= Which linkage group the locus is located on
  Copy		= Whether allele frequency is reported for paternal/maternal copy
  Allele	= Which locus/allele's frequency is reported
  Type		= The type of the allele
  SAY		= Selective effect s of SAY allele in males
  SAI		= Selective effect s of SAI allele in males
  SAII		= Selective effect s of SAII allele in males
  Epsilon	= Epistatis effect size epsilon
  Scenario	= Whether transition is Y->A (YM_AM) or Y->W (YM_FD)
  Epistasis	= Type of epistasis (COA = Coadaptation, DOM = Dominance, DXD = overdominance)
